# RPiRENA
Raspberry Pi based dosimeter for measuring radiation levels at aerospace and aviation altitudes. 
RPiRENA - RPi stands for Raspberry Pi and RENA stands for
Read-out Electronics for Nuclear Applications.
 
The assembled dosimeter is based on the pre-existing
RPiRENA developed by Professor Stephan Bottcher of the
Christian-Albrechts-Universit¨at zu Kiel.

The dosimeter is mobile, relatively small and lightweight (∼2
kg), and it can be transported to almost any location around
the world as a unit.

Two commercial s2744-08 silicon PIN diodes (manufactured
by Hamamatsu Photonics) were used.

Battery powered - power consumption is enough for long-haul
flights.
